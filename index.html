		        <p>Santa tell me if you're really there<br>
		          Don't make me fall in love again<br>
		          If he won't be here next year<br>
		          Santa tell me if he really cares<br>
		          'Cause I can give it all away if he won't be here next year<br>

		          Feeling Christmas all around<br>
		          And I'm trying to play it cool<br>
		          But it's hard to focus when I see you walking around the room<br>
		          Let it snow, it's blasting now<br>
		          But I won't get in the mood<br>
		          I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know<br>
		          It's true love that he thinks of<br>
		          So next Christmas<br>
		          I'm not all alone, boy<br>

		          Fell in love on Christmas night<br>
		          But on New Year's Day I woke up and he wasn't by my side<br>
		          Now I need someone to hold<br>
		          Be my fire in the cold<br>
		          But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling<br>
		          Or if it's true love that he thinks of<br>
		          So next Christmas<br>
		          I'm not all alone, babe<br>

		          Oh, I wanna have him beside me like oh-oh-oh<br>
		          On the 25th by the fire place, oh-oh-oh<br>
		          But I don't want no broken heart<br>
		          This year I've got to be smart<br>
